# JOYTOURHUB

> A web application that handles everything from tour guide expense reporting to office review, approval, and payment. After a Day Tour or Inbound Tour, the guide only needs to enter the tour code and the expenses incurred. The correct rates are applied automatically based on the guide's grade and the vehicle used, and the report is sent straight to the office.

# Payment Cycle
* Weekly cycle: last Wednesday through this Tuesday
* Reports within this period are classified as Payable/Unpaid/Paid. 


# Getting Started
Docker is used only for the PostgreSQL database. The Django app itself runs directly on the host with `python manage.py runserver`, so the database container container must  be running first. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Docker

### 1. Start the PostgreSQL container
```
docker run -d \
  --name tour-report-db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=your_db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=your_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v tour_report_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres:16
```

If the container already exists, just start it: 

```
docker start tour-report-db
```

### 2. Set up the Django app
```
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Prepare the environment file
cp .env.example .en
```

### 3. Run migrations and start the server
```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

# Environment Variables
Set the following in your `.env` file (adjustto match your project). The values must match the ones used when starting the PostgreSQL container. 

```
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,localhost

POSTGRES_DB=your_db
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

# Deployment
* Hosted on an AWS Lightsal instance. 
* PostgreSQL runs in a Docker container on the instance; the Django app runse on the host. 
```
# Make sure the database container is running
docker start tour-report-db

# Pull the latest code and apply changes
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

# Project Structure
Adjust to match your actual structure.
